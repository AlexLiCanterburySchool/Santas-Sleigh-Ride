1. Design the Game Structure
Divide the game into classes: Think about the entities in your game.
A Sleigh for the player-controlled object.
Obstacles like clouds and chimneys.
A GameEngine class to handle the game logic.
Use Object-Oriented Programming principles. Each entity should have its own class, with attributes and methods to control behavior.

2. Game Board Representation
Think of the game board as a grid (2D array).
Use characters or symbols to represent different elements:
'S' for the sleigh.
'O' for obstacles.
Empty spaces as ' '.
Print the board each frame to show the game state.

3. Player Movement
The player should be able to move left and right within bounds.
Use a variable, like positionX, to track the sleigh's horizontal position.
Adjust this position based on user input ('a' for left, 'd' for right).

4. Obstacle Behavior
Obstacles should spawn at the top of the board and move downward each frame.
Store obstacles in a list.
Each obstacle has an x (horizontal) and y (vertical) position.
Update their positions in a loop each frame.

5. Collision Detection
Check if any obstacle occupies the same position as the sleigh.
If obstacle.x == sleigh.x && obstacle.y == sleigh.y, then it's a collision.
End the game if a collision is detected.

6. Random Spawning
Use a random number generator to:
Determine the horizontal position of each new obstacle.
Randomly decide whether to spawn a cloud or a chimney.

7. Game Loop
Your game needs a loop to:
Render the board (print it to the console).
Update the positions of all obstacles.
Accept user input and move the sleigh.
Check for collisions.
Increment the score over time.
Use a condition, like a boolean gameOver flag, to exit the loop when the game ends.

8. Delays and Input
Add a small delay after each frame using Thread.sleep(milliseconds) to slow the game and make it playable.
Use a scanner to take user input for movement in each frame.

9. Scoring
Keep a score variable that increases with every frame or successfully avoided obstacle.
Display the score alongside the game board.

10. Testing and Debugging
Test the game frequently to ensure:
Obstacles spawn correctly.
Player input works as expected.
Collisions are detected accurately.
